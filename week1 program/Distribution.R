# HW1: distributions
#
# In this exercise, you'll learn how to work with distributions in R.
#
# 0. Read the documentation regarding distributions, which you can access using `?Distributions`.
# 1. Set the random seed to zero and save the random seed vector to `seed`. (hint: use the command `seed <- .Random.seed`).
# 2. Assign to a variable `prob1` the probability that 5 students in the class have the same birthday. (hint: as of the writing of this exercise, there are 285 registered students)
# 3. Let X have a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of 2. Assign to a variable `prob2` the probability that X is betwee 0 and 3.
# 4. Let Y have an exponential distribution with mean equal to 3. Assign to `sample_exp` a sample of 10 random variates drawn from the distribution of Y.
