# HW1: factors
#
# 1. Create two factors `f1` and `f2` containing the numbers from 1 to 100 included, and 1 to 20 included.
# 2. Concatenate these two factors in a factor `f3`.
# 3. Create a table `t1` giving the number of times each number appear in `f3`.
# 4. Copy `f1` into a factor `f4` and rearrange it in decreasing order. (hint: make sure its levels are in decreased order too. You might want to look up the function `rev()`)
