# HW1: list6
#
# 1. Create a list `l1` consist of 26 components from 'a' to 'z'. (hint: check the variable letters)
# 2. Create a list `l2` consist of 26 components from 1 to 26.
# 3. Combine `l1` and `l2` to a new list `l3`. `l3` has 2 elements as `l1` and `l2`.
# 4. Combine `l1` and `l2` to a new list `l4`. `l4` has 52 elements as the elements of `l1` and `l2`.
