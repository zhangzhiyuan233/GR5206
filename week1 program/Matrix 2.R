# HW1: matrix3
#
# 1. Set the random seed as 5206. (hint: check the set.seed function)
#    Save the random seed vector to `seed`.(hint: use the command seed <- .Random.seed)
# 2. Create a vector `v1` of length 30 by sampling from 1 to 30 without replacement.(hint: check the sample function)
# 3. Convert the vector `v1` into a 5 x 6 matrix `m1` filled by row.
# 4. Calculate the L-1 norm of matrix `m1` defined as the the maximum absolute column sum of the matrix and assign it to `n1`.
# 5. Calculate the L-infinity norm of matrix `m1` defined as the maximum absolute row sum of the matrix and assign it to `n2`.
# 6. Calculate the Frobenius norm of matrix `m1` defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of its elements and assign it to `n3`.
