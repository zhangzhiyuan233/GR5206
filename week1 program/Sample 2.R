# HW1: simple probabilities
#
# Estimate the probability to have 5 'heads' in a row
#
# 1. Set the random seed to zero and save the random seed vector to `seed`. (hint: use the command `seed <- .Random.seed`).
# 2. Create a vector `random_seq` of n = 50000 random numbers equal to 0 ('heads') or 1 ('tails').
# 3. Reshape `random_seq` into a matrice `random_mat` of shape 5 x 10000.
# 4. Sum `random_mat` over its rows, to get a vector `random_sum`. (hint : check the functions `rowSums` and `colSums`).
# 5. Assign to a variable `prob` the number of elements of `random_sum` equal to 0 and divide it by 10000. You get an estimate of the probability of having 5 heads in a row!
#    For higher n, you will get even better estimates. Try different values of n to see how prob evolves, but make sure that your final solution uses 50000.
