# HW1: sampling
#
# In this exercise, you'll compute the probability of getting a double six exactly three times in a row when throwing consecutive six faced dices.
# While it could be solved by hand, the goal is to learn how to use sampling.
#
# 1. Set the random seed to zero and save the random seed vector to `seed`. (hint: use the command `seed <- .Random.seed`).
# 2. Assign to `sample_space` a data frame with 36 rows and columns named `dice1` and `dice2`.
# Each row should contain a different combination of the results for the two dices, e.g. the first row is (1, 1), the second row is (2, 1), ... up to (6, 6).
# (Hint: look at the function `expand.grid`)
# 3. Assign to `sampled_rows` a vector of 100'000 uniformly sampled numbers between 1 and 36.
# (Hint: look at the functions `sample` and  `sample.int`)
# 4. Assign to `sampled_events` the data frame obtained by selecting the 100'000 rows in `sampled_rows` from the `sample_space` data frame.
# 5. Assign to `double_six` a `logical` vector of dimension 100'000 where each element is `TRUE`
# if the corresonding row of `sampled_events` is a double six and `FALSE` otherwise.
# 6. Assign to `double_six_run_length` an `integer` vector corresponding to the length of each run of double six.
# (Hint: look at the function `rle`)
# 7. Assign to `probability` the probability to obtain a double six exactly two times in a row
# by counting the number of times such an event happens in `double_six` and dividing by 100'000.
