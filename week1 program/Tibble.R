# HW1: tibble4
library(tibble)

# 1. Consider the data frame `airquality`. Convert it into a tibble `t1`.
# 2. Calculate the total number of 'NA' for each variable and summarize it into a vector `v1`.
#    Make sure the vector has the same names as the column names of `t1`.
# 3. Omit all rows which have 'NA' values and assign it to `t2`.
# 4. Sort the new data frame `t2` by column Temp(ascending) and then by column Ozone(ascending). Assign it to `t3`.(hint: check the order function)
