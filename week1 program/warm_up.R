# HW1: warm-up
#
# 1. Create a vector `x` that will contain integers between 21 and 29 included.
# 2. Copy `x` row-wise into a 3 x 3 matrix `y`.
# 3. Create a matrix `z` as the matrix square of `y` (hint: think about the difference between `^` and `%*%`).
# 4. Change the row names of `z` and  the columns of `y` to `c("a", "b", "c")`.
# 5. Assign the matrix product between the transpose of `z` and the entry-wise square of `y` to a new matrix called `w`.
