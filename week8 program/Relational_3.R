# HW7: relational data
#'
# In this exercise, we will walk you through a complete process of manipulating
# relational data. We suggest the functions you can use to create the tibbles
# and the plots, but you are free to use the methods you are the most comfortable with.
# Make sure that the outputs look exactly like the ones you are supposed to create.
#'
# Throughout the exercise:
#    - Do NOT use `for`, `while` or `repeat` loops.
#    - Use `%>%` to structure your operations.
#    - Use `theme_light()` for the plots.
#'
# 1. Load the packages `tidyverse`, `lubridate` and `GGally`.
#    Use `read_csv()` to read the datasets:
#       - `data/department_info.csv` into a tibble `department`.
#       - `data/employee_info.csv` into a tibble `employee`.
#       - `data/student_counselling_info.csv` into a tibble `s_admission`.
#       - `/course/data/student_performance_info.csv` into a tibble `s_performance`.
#    All datasets are located in the directory `data/` with the exception of the last one.
#    Background:
#       - `department` has information about departments in the university,
#         including `Department_ID`, `Department_Name` and `DOE` (date of
#         establishment).
#       - `employee` has information about professors, including `Employee_ID`,
#         `DOB` (date of birth), `DOJ` (date of university joining) and
#         `Department_ID` where the professors belong to.
#       - `s_admission` has information about admission of students, including
#         `Student_ID`, `DOA` (date of admission), `DOB`, `Department_Choices`
#         (choices student made during counselling) and `Department_Admission`
#         (department offered to student).
#       - `s_performance` has information about performance details of a student,
#         including `Student_ID`, `Semester_Name`, `Paper_ID`, `Paper_Name` and
#         `Marks` (marks scored in examination).
#    After preprocessing all the tibbles, we will have a final tibble `engie`,
#    with integrated information of students at the Engineering School.

# 2. We will start by cleaning and aggregating some new columns for our interest.
#    Create a tibble `employee_new` of size 1000 x 5 with columns `Employee_ID`,
#    `Department_ID`, `age`, `seniority` and `seniority_level`, where `age` is
#    the age of the professor, `seniority` is the year of teaching, and
#    `seniority_level` shows whether a professor is junior (`seniority` <= 10)
#    or senior (`seniority` > 10).
#    To do this, you can use:
#       - `mutate()` to create the columns
#          - `age` and `seniority` from `DOB` and `DOJ` repectively by
#            - Creating an interval with `%--%`, `today()` and `dyears()`.
#            - Rounding the years to integers with `round()`.
#          - `seniority_level` to categorize `seniority` by
#            - Cutting `seniority` with `cut()`, setting
#              - `breaks = min(seniority), 10, max(seniority)`;
#              - `labels = c("junior", "senior")`;
#              - `include.lowest = TRUE`.
#       - `dplyr::select()` to select the desired columns.
#    To check your result, `employee_new` prints to:

#    Store the result into a tibble `department_engie` of size 17 x 2 with columns

#    To do this, you can use:

# 7. With department and faculty information joined, we can investigate the

#    a tibble `department_size` of size size 14 x 2 with columns `Department_Name`
#    and `n`, where `n` is the department size in ascending order.
#    To do this, you can use:
#       - `dplyr::count()` to count `Department_Name` (the number of rows for
#          each department is the number of faculty).
#       - `arrange()` to sort the department size (i.e., `n`).
#    To check your result, `department_size` prints to:

# 8. We will use `department_size` in the previous question as a helper tibble
#    for sorting the levels of `Department_Name` in `employee_joined`. Update
#    the original `employee_joined` tibble so that `Department_Name` becomes a
#    `factor` whose levels are sorted by department size.
#    To do this, you can use:
#       - `mutate()` to create (update) the column `Department_Name` by
#         - Making `Department_Name` a factor with `factor()`.
#           - Set `levels` of `Department_Name` as `Department_Name` in
#             `department_size` with `pull()`.
#    To check your result, the new `employee_joined` prints to:

# 9. One important aspect of faculty make-up is seniority. Using `employee_joined`,
#    draw horizontal stacked bar charts for `Department_Name` with distribution

#    To do this, you can use:

# 11. The tibble `student_joined` contains complete information about students
#     at the Engineering School. For initial exploration, draw horizontal
#     boxplots for `mean_score` vs. `school_year`. The boxplots should be sorted
#     by descending medians.
#     To do this, you can use:
#        - `ggplot()` to initialize a ggplot object and specify the variables to plot.
#          - `fct_reorder()` to order the levels of `school_year` by `mean_score`.
#        - `geom_boxplot()` to draw boxplots.
#        - `coord_flip()` to make the boxplots horizontal.
#        - `labs()` to format the labels such that:
#           - `title = "Student Academic Performance by Class Standing at Engineering School"`
#           - `subtitle = "Distribution is similar across years."`
#           - `x = "Class Standing"`
#           - `y = "Mean Paper Score"`
#     Store the plot into a `ggplot` object `g2`.

# 12. We would like to explore what could affect a student's academic performance
#     from the faculty aspect, particularly in seniority of professors. Create
#     a tibble `employee_senior` from `employee_joined` of size 14 x 2 with
#     columns `Department_ID` and `seniority`, where `seniority` is the median
#     seniority for each department.
#     To do this, you can use:
#        - `group_by()` to group data by `Department_ID`.
#        - `summarize()` to compute an overall median of `seniority`.
#     To check your result, `employee_senior` prints to:
#     # A tibble: 14 x 2

#     To do this, you can use:
