# Throughout the exercise:
#    - Do NOT use `for`, `while` or `repeat` loops.
#    - Use `%>%` to structure your operations.
#    - Use `theme_light()` for the plots.
#    - For graphs with titles, make the format as
# `theme_light()+theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+theme_light()`.

# 3. Create a tibble `average_rating_in_different_years` of dimension 20x2.
#    The procedure should first create a new column called `year_of_rating` that
#    gets the year of the rating and converted into a factor variable. Then we
#    group the dataset by `year_of_rating` and summarize the dataset such that
#    we calculate the average ratings of
#    each year and store averages in a column called `average_rating_of_year`.
#    To do that, you can use:
#      - `mutate()` and `as.factor()` to coerce the year of `date` into a
#        factor variable.
#      - `group_by()` to group by `year_of_rating`.
#      - `summarize` to summarize the mean of ratings of different year and
#        store the value into `average_rating_of_year`.
#    To check your result, `average_rating_in_different_years` prints to:
#    # A tibble: 20 x 2

#    Name the title as `"2004 and 2005 have lower average ratings"`,

#        vs. `year_of_rating`.
#      - `labs()` to name the title as

# 5. Extract the year of movies from `title` column in the `movies` dataset.
#    Store the values into a new column called `year` and convert values into numeric.
#    To do this, you can use:
#      - `mutate()`, `map_chr` and `as.numeric()` to generate a new column called `year`
#        and transform values into numeric.
#        (hint: pay attention to `substr()` to extract the characters that we want.)
#    Store the returned dataset into `movies`.
#'
#    *Optional material*: The `title` column format is relatively clean here. What if
#    we have 4-digit years and 2-digit years mix (e.g. 1995, 96, 02, 2005, etc.)?
#    Then the method above will not work and how should we modify the code or use other methods?
#    Way 1: Locate the index of `(` and `)` then use `substr` to extract years.
#    Way 2: Use regular expression. For instance, you can combine `gsub()` with
#    `pattern = ".+\\(([0-9]+)\\)"`, `replacement = "\\1"`, and `x = title` in order to
#    extract the year.
#    Here, `gsub()` matches to argument pattern within each element of a character
#    vector, and then replace the designed pattern.
#    The pattern is `".+\\(([0-9]+)\\)"`.
#    `.` means the string starts with a character and `.+` means there are one or more characters.
#    `\\(` and `\\)` means there really exist parenthese. `\\` is just the syntax for escaping.
#    `([0-9]+)` means there exists a string of characters that can be converted to numeric.
#    The replacement is `\\1`.
#    `\\1` means we only need to keep the characters that can be converted to numeric.

# 11.Calculate the interval of time passed between the `date` corresponding the
#    rating and the release `year` from `ratings_of_movies` dataset,
#    and store this interval into a column called `interval`. You can assume
#    that a film released in a given year was actually released on January 1st.
#    Then, convert the units of `interval` into years and store its
#    values into a new column called `years_passed`.
#    Finally, filter out rows with `years_passed` less or equal to 60.
#    To do this, you can use:
#      - `mutate()` to create two required columns.
#        (hint 1: pay attention to `make_datetime()` to convert the release year
#        into a date and remembers that dates/datetimes can
#        be substracted to create intervals)
#        (hint 2: intervals can be divided by durations, and the `dyears()`
#        function can help your compute the number of years that have passed)
#      - `filter` to filter out rows with `years_passed` less or equal to 60.
#       Store the returned dataset to `ratings_over_time`.
#    To check your result, `ratings_over_time` prints to:
#    # A tibble: 130,087 x 7
